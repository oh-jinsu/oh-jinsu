As a Full-stack Developer with four years of experience, I specialize in driving substantial business growth through high-impact software solutions. At an interior tech startup, I spearheaded software planning and development that grew annual revenue from KRW 500 million to KRW 2.5 billion and contributed to securing over KRW 1 billion in external investment.

My technical approach focuses on maximizing the accessibility and productivity of web-based technologies (React, HTML5 Canvas API, Node.js, AWS) to modernize traditional workflows and improve operational efficiency. Key achievements include leading the company website overhaul, which successfully boosted Monthly Unique Visitors (MUV) from 400 to 2,000 and increased conversion rates by over 300%.

Crucially, I developed an Interior Design SaaS—after proactively acquiring practical design expertise—that cut the average design work time from 8 hours to just 1 hour. Furthermore, I established a data-driven, performance-centric culture by implementing KPI tracking and building a robust back-office system, which provided the critical metrics needed for successful funding rounds.

I am now focused on leveraging this end-to-end experience to create scalable services that elevate the customer experience, benefiting not just a single enterprise but the industry as a whole.
