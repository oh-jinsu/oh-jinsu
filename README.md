As a full-stack developer with 4 years of experience, I have led software planning and development at an interior design startup, helping grow revenue from ₩500M to ₩2.5B, improve operational efficiency, and secure over ₩1B in investment.

Leveraging web technologies such as React, HTML5 Canvas, Node.js, and AWS, I’ve focused on optimizing traditional workflows and turning technical innovation into measurable business results.

I led the planning and development of the company website using Next.js, increasing monthly unique visitors from around 500 to 2,000 and boosting conversion rates by more than 4x. Additionally, I taught myself design practices to build an interior design framework as an HTML5 Canvas-based SaaS, reducing average project time from 8 hours to 1 hour. I also introduced KPI tracking and built a Remix-based back office, helping establish a performance-driven culture and contributing to securing over ₩1B in investment based on clear metrics.

Building on these experiences, I aim to create scalable services that enhance customer experiences not only at the company level but across the entire industry.
